Personal solution to the Testimonial Page challenge from devChallenges: [Testimonial Page | devChallenges.io | Real-life Coding Projects to become a Software Engineer](https://devchallenges.io/challenge/testimonial-page)

**NOTE: I didn't break down the page into multiple components in order to save time.**

## Developing

**Useful commands:**

```bash

```
